# Fixing C# locking and exception handling errors (2025-06-08 22:48:35)

    C:\dev\ktsu-dev\AppDataStorage\AppDataStorage.Test\AppDataTests.cs(976,20): error CS9216: A value of type 'System.Threading.Lock' converted to a different type will use likely unintended monitor-based locking in 'lock' statement.
    C:\dev\ktsu-dev\AppDataStorage\AppDataStorage.Test\AppDataTests.cs(799,5): error CA1031: Modify 'TestConcurrentAccess' to catch a more specific allowed exception type, or rethrow the exception (https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1031)

I'll help you fix those compilation errors in your AppDataTests.cs file. Let me first examine the file to understand the issues.

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Now let me read the specific lines where the errors occur:

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Now I can see both issues. Let me also check around line 976 for the CS9216 error:

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Perfect! Now I can identify both errors:

1. **CS9216 error on line 976**: In the `TestLockObjectIsCorrectType` method, there's an `Assert.IsInstanceOfType<Lock>(lockObj, ...)` call. The issue is that in .NET 9+, `System.Threading.Lock` is a value type, but it's being converted to `object` which causes the warning about monitor-based locking.

2. **CA1031 error on line 799**: In the `TestConcurrentAccess` method, there's a `catch (Exception ex)` that catches all exceptions, which is flagged by the code analyzer.

Let me fix both issues:

Good, the CA1031 error is fixed. Now I need to fix the CS9216 error. The issue is with the `Assert.IsInstanceOfType<Lock>` call. In .NET 9+, `Lock` is a value type, and converting it to `object` (which happens when comparing types) causes the warning. I need to adjust the test to handle this properly:

---



---

I see the issue. The generic overload is preferred, but the original issue was that `Lock` is a value type in .NET 9+ and converting it to `object` causes the CS9216 warning. Let me try a different approach by checking the type directly without boxing:

---



---

Perfect! Both compilation errors have been fixed:

1. **CS9216 error**: Fixed by avoiding the boxing of the `Lock` value type in .NET 9+. Instead of converting to `object` which would cause monitor-based locking warnings, I now call `GetType()` directly on the `Lock` value and compare it to `typeof(Lock)`.

2. **CA1031 error**: Fixed by making the exception catch more specific using a `when` clause that excludes `OperationCanceledException` and `ThreadInterruptedException`, which are typically used for thread control and shouldn't be caught in this test scenario.

The changes maintain the original test functionality while addressing the compilation errors:

- ```976:983:AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs
  // In .NET 9+, Lock is a value type, so we check the type directly
  Type lockType = TestAppData.Lock.GetType();
  Assert.AreEqual(typeof(Lock), lockType, "Lock should be of type Lock in .NET 9+");
  ```

- ```799:799:AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs
  catch (Exception ex) when (ex is not OperationCanceledException and not ThreadInterruptedException)
  ```

The fixes should resolve both compilation errors without changing the intended behavior of the tests.

I can see there's a test failure in the `TestLoadOrCreateWithCorruptJsonRecursiveRecovery` test. The error indicates that a `File.Move` operation is failing because the destination file already exists. Let me examine the code around line 196 in AppData.cs to understand the issue.

---

Read file: AppDataStorage/AppData.cs

Now let me look at the failing test to understand what it's trying to do:
