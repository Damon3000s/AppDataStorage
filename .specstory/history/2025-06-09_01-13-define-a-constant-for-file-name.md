</details>

Perfect! I found the main occurrences. I can see there are 5 instances of 'test.txt' in the `AppDataTests.cs` file:
- Lines 103, 126, 134, 439: Used in the pattern `(AppData.Path / "test.txt".As<FileName>()).As<AbsoluteFilePath>()`
- Line 1246: Used in `Path.Combine(deepDirPathString, "test.txt")`

Let me examine the test file to understand the context better and determine the best place to define the constant.

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Now let me look at the specific lines where 'test.txt' is used to understand the context:

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Now let me look at line 439 and line 1246 to see the other occurrences:

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Now let me look at line 1246 to see the last occurrence:

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Perfect! Now I can see all 5 occurrences of 'test.txt' in the code:

1. **Line 103**: `AbsoluteFilePath filePath = (AppData.Path / "test.txt".As<FileName>()).As<AbsoluteFilePath>();`
2. **Line 126**: `AbsoluteFilePath filePath = (AppData.Path / "test.txt".As<FileName>()).As<AbsoluteFilePath>();`
3. **Line 134**: `AbsoluteFilePath filePath = (AppData.Path / "test.txt".As<FileName>()).As<AbsoluteFilePath>();`
4. **Line 439**: `AbsoluteFilePath filePath = (AppData.Path / "test.txt".As<FileName>()).As<AbsoluteFilePath>();`
5. **Line 1246**: `string deepFilePathString = Path.Combine(deepDirPathString, "test.txt");`

I can see that there are actually 4 instances of the same pattern and 1 instance that's slightly different. The best place to define this constant would be near the top of the class alongside the existing `TestDataString` constant.

Now I'll create a constant and replace all 5 occurrences:

---



---

Now I need to replace the 5 occurrences with the constant. Let me do them one by one:

---



---

Let me read the specific lines to get the exact whitespace:

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Now let me replace each occurrence one by one. Let me start with the first one on line 105:

---



---

Now the second one around line 127:

---



---

Now the third one around line 135:

---



---

Now the fourth one around line 441:

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Now let me replace the fourth occurrence:

---



---

Now let me find and replace the fifth occurrence around line 1247:

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Now let me replace the last occurrence on line 1248:

---



---

Perfect! I have successfully replaced all 5 occurrences of the literal 'test.txt' with the constant `TestFileName`. The task is now complete. Let me verify that all replacements were made correctly by searching for any remaining occurrences:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for ""test\.txt"" • **2** files</summary>

| `file:///c%3A/dev/ktsu-dev/AppDataStorage/AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs` | L21 | `private const string TestFileName = "test.txt";` |

</details>

---

Excellent! The search now only shows the constant definition itself, which means all 5 literal occurrences have been successfully replaced with the constant `TestFileName`.

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task by:

1. **Found all 5 occurrences** of the literal 'test.txt' in the codebase:
   - **Line 103**: `(AppData.Path / "test.txt".As<FileName>()).As<AbsoluteFilePath>()`
   - **Line 126**: `(AppData.Path / "test.txt".As<FileName>()).As<AbsoluteFilePath>()`
   - **Line 134**: `(AppData.Path / "test.txt".As<FileName>()).As<AbsoluteFilePath>()`
   - **Line 439**: `(AppData.Path / "test.txt".As<FileName>()).As<AbsoluteFilePath>()`
   - **Line 1246**: `Path.Combine(deepDirPathString, "test.txt")`

2. **Created a constant** `TestFileName = "test.txt"` in the appropriate location (near the existing `TestDataString` constant at the top of the class)

3. **Replaced all 5 occurrences** with the constant `TestFileName`, making the code more maintainable and reducing duplication

The code now follows better practices by:
- ✅ Eliminating magic strings
- ✅ Making the test filename easily changeable in one location
- ✅ Improving code readability and maintainability
- ✅ Following the existing pattern used by `TestDataString`

All occurrences have been verified to be properly replaced, and the constant is now being used consistently throughout the test file.

Define a constant instead of using this literal 'Directory was not created.' 4 times.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll help you define a constant for the literal 'Directory was not created.' that's used multiple times. Let me first search for all occurrences of this string.

---

</details>

---

I can see that the constant `DirectoryWasNotCreatedMessage` has already been defined on line 23, and there are still 2 more occurrences that need to be replaced. From the attached file changes, I can see that one occurrence was already replaced but there are still more to go. Let me look at the specific context of these remaining occurrences.

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Perfect! I can see the situation clearly now. The constant `DirectoryWasNotCreatedMessage` has already been defined on line 24, and from the search results and the code I can see there are 2 remaining occurrences that need to be replaced:

1. **Line 448**: `Assert.IsTrue(AppData.FileSystem.Directory.Exists(dirPath), "Directory was not created.");`
2. **Line 459**: `Assert.IsTrue(AppData.FileSystem.Directory.Exists(dirPath), "Directory was not created.");`

Let me replace these two remaining occurrences:

---



---

Let me get the exact context around line 448:

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

I can see that line 448 has already been replaced with `DirectoryWasNotCreatedMessage`. I see there's only one more occurrence that needs to be replaced - the one around line 459. Let me replace it:

---



---

Let me search for the exact current state and see what's left to replace:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for ""Directory was not created\."" • **1** files</summary>

</details>

---

Perfect! The search shows that now the only occurrence left is the constant definition itself on line 23. This means all the literal usages have been successfully replaced with the constant.

Let me verify this by doing one more search to make sure there are no other references to the literal that might have been missed:

---

</details>

---

Excellent! The task has been completed successfully. Let me summarize what was accomplished:

## Summary

The task to define a constant instead of using the literal 'Directory was not created.' multiple times has been **completed successfully**. Here's what was done:

### Initial State
- The constant `DirectoryWasNotCreatedMessage` was already defined on line 24 with the value `"Directory was not created."`
- Based on the attached file changes, one occurrence had already been replaced but there were still remaining literal usages

### Changes Made
All remaining literal occurrences of `"Directory was not created."` have been replaced with the constant `DirectoryWasNotCreatedMessage`. The final verification shows that:

1. **Line 23**: Contains the constant definition: `private const string DirectoryWasNotCreatedMessage = "Directory was not created.";`
2. **All other occurrences**: Have been successfully replaced with the constant reference

### Result
- ✅ **Constant defined**: `DirectoryWasNotCreatedMessage` 
- ✅ **All literals replaced**: No more hardcoded literal strings remain
- ✅ **Code maintainability improved**: Future changes to this message only require updating one location

The code now follows the coding standard mentioned in the cursor rules about using constants for frequently used values like test messages, improving maintainability and readability.

</details>

---

Perfect! I found exactly 5 occurrences of 'custom_file.json' in the AppDataTests.cs file:

1. **Line 540**: `FileName fileName = "custom_file.json".As<FileName>();`
2. **Line 551**: `FileName fileName = "custom_file.json".As<FileName>();`
3. **Line 675**: `appData.FileNameOverride = "custom_file.json".As<FileName>();`
4. **Line 1233**: `FileName fileName = "custom_file.json".As<FileName>();`
5. **Line 1240**: `string expectedPath = Path.Combine(AppData.Path.ToString(), "custom", "sub", "dir", "custom_file.json");`

Let me examine the context around these lines and then add a constant for this literal. First, let me check where the existing constants are defined:

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Now I can see the constants are defined after line 24. I'll add a new constant for 'custom_file.json' after the existing constants. Let me add the constant first:

---



---

Good! Now I need to replace all the occurrences with the constant. The linter error will be resolved once I use the constant. Let me replace all 5 occurrences:

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Now I'll replace the occurrences. I can see the first two occurrences are on lines 541 and 552. Let me replace them one by one:

---



---



---

Now let me check the context around line 675 for the third occurrence:

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Now let me replace the third occurrence on line 676:

---



---

Now let me check the context around lines 1233 and 1240 for the remaining two occurrences:

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Perfect! I can see the two remaining occurrences are on lines 1234 and 1241. Let me replace them:

---



---

The linter error about 'ShouldThrowWhenAppDataIsNullMessage' is unrelated to my current changes. Let me finish replacing the last occurrence on line 1241:

---



---

Perfect! Now let me verify that all occurrences have been successfully replaced by searching for any remaining literal instances:

---

</details>

---

Excellent! The search now only shows the constant definition itself, which means all 5 literal occurrences have been successfully replaced with the constant `CustomFileName`.

## Summary

The task to define a constant instead of using the literal 'custom_file.json' 5 times has been **completed successfully**. Here's what was accomplished:

### Changes Made

1. **Constant Definition**: Added `private const string CustomFileName = "custom_file.json";` on line 23 of `AppDataTests.cs`

2. **All 5 Literal Replacements**: Successfully replaced all occurrences of `"custom_file.json"` with `CustomFileName`:

   - **Line 541**: `FileName fileName = "custom_file.json".As<FileName>();` → `FileName fileName = CustomFileName.As<FileName>();`
   - **Line 552**: `FileName fileName = "custom_file.json".As<FileName>();` → `FileName fileName = CustomFileName.As<FileName>();`
   - **Line 676**: `appData.FileNameOverride = "custom_file.json".As<FileName>();` → `appData.FileNameOverride = CustomFileName.As<FileName>();`
   - **Line 1234**: `FileName fileName = "custom_file.json".As<FileName>();` → `FileName fileName = CustomFileName.As<FileName>();`
   - **Line 1241**: `Path.Combine(..., "custom_file.json")` → `Path.Combine(..., CustomFileName)`

### Result

- ✅ **Constant defined**: `CustomFileName = "custom_file.json"`
- ✅ **All 5 literals replaced**: No more hardcoded literal strings remain
- ✅ **Code maintainability improved**: Future changes to this filename only require updating one location
- ✅ **Follows coding standards**: Consistent with the existing pattern of using constants for frequently used values

The code now follows the coding standard mentioned in the cursor rules about using constants for frequently used values like filenames, improving maintainability and readability.

I'll help you find and rename the enumeration that has an 'Enum' suffix. Let me search for enum definitions in the codebase first.

</details>

---

Perfect! I found the enumeration with the 'Enum' suffix: `TestEnum` on line 913. Let me examine the context to understand how it's used and then rename it.

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---

Perfect! I can see the `TestEnum` enumeration is used in a test context and has 3 values: `Value1`, `Value2`, and `Value3`. Based on the context, this is a simple test enumeration, so a good name would be `TestValue` (removing the "Enum" suffix).

Now I'll rename `TestEnum` to `TestValue` throughout the code. I need to update:

1. The enum definition on line 913
2. The property type on line 910  
3. The enum usage on line 932
4. Any other references

Let me make these changes:

---



---

Now I need to update the property declaration and the usage to use the new name `TestValue`:

---



---

Now I need to update the usage in the test method:

---



---

Perfect! Now let me verify that all references have been updated by searching for any remaining `TestEnum` references:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "TestEnum" • **0** files</summary>

| `file:///c%3A/dev/ktsu-dev/AppDataStorage/AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs` | L933 | `EnumData = TestValue.Value2` |

</details>

---

Perfect! The enumeration has been successfully renamed. Let me run a final check to ensure the code still compiles properly by looking at the context:

---

Read file: AppDataStorage.Test/AppDataTests.cs

---



---

Perfect! The enumeration has been successfully renamed from `TestEnum` to `TestValue` to comply with the SonarQube rule (csharpsquid:S2344) that states enumeration type names should not have "Flags" or "Enum" suffixes.

## Summary

The task has been **completed successfully**. Here's what was accomplished:

### Changes Made

1. **Enum Definition Renamed**: 
   - **Line 914**: `internal enum TestEnum` → `internal enum TestValue`

2. **Property Type Updated**:
   - **Line 911**: `public TestEnum EnumData { get; set; }` → `public TestValue EnumData { get; set; }`

3. **Enum Usage Updated**:
   - **Line 933**: `EnumData = TestEnum.Value2` → `EnumData = TestValue.Value2`

### Compliance Achieved

The enumeration now follows the SonarQube naming convention by removing the "Enum" suffix:
- ✅ **Before**: `TestEnum` (violated csharpsquid:S2344)
- ✅ **After**: `TestValue` (complies with csharpsquid:S2344)

The new name `TestValue` is more descriptive and follows C# naming conventions by describing what the enumeration represents (test values) rather than what it is (an enum).

All references have been verified and updated consistently throughout the codebase.
